## Goals

**Recommend a schedule(s) for the WYWT Street Team to maximize gala attendance and donations.**

## Questions (answering these will help us get to our goal)

1. Which stations have the heaviest traffic?

2. What times of day are the station's busiest?

3. Are weekends different than weekends?

4. Can we find people with more disposable income who are more likely to donate at these busier stations?

5. Can we take advantage of bigger events to find boosts at otherwise "lower" traffic stations?

## Deliverables

1. Presentation describing our findings and recommendations.

2. EDA Analysis using python and more advanced modules.
